var friends = ["Jo","Chris","Ash","Linda"];
friends.pop();
console.log(friends);

// I used the pop() method for the array of string elements.
// This method removes the last element from and array.
// The output is [ 'Jo', 'Chris', 'Ash' ].

var ages =[23,24,27,30];
ages.push(70,35);
console.log(ages);
// I used the push() method for the array of integer elements.
// This method adds one or more element to the end of the array.
// The output is [ 23, 24, 27, 30, 70, 35 ].

var likeCakes = [false,true,true,false];
likeCakes.shift();
console.log(likeCakes);

// I used the shift() method for the array of boolean elements.
// This method removes the first element from an array.
// The output is [ true, true, false ].

// ####
// My understanding of index positions is that fist element 
// starts with '0' and the second one listed would be '1' and so forth.
// I will also demo this below.

var friends = ["Jo","Chris","Ash","Linda"];

// So in this array of string, the element "Jo" would be index number '0'. 
// Then we could move on to the first element which would be "Chris" and this elements idex number is '1'.
